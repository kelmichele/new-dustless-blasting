                    <p>Powder Coating is an advanced method of applying a decorative and protective finish to a wide range of materials and products that are used by both industrial and consumer markets. The powder coating is a mixture of finely ground particles and pigment and resin which is sprayed onto a surface that is charged electrically so the particles adhere to the ground surface until heated and fused into a smooth coating in the cure oven which gives you a stunning product.</p>

                    <p>Powder coating does not fade and can be applied to all metals, wood, fiberglass, so its up to your imagination and needs as to what parts are right for your items.  Our powder coating offers excellent durability and will extend the life of your product! Our powder coating is resistant to chipping cracking and peeling and is perfect for metals exposed to the elements!</p>

                    <p>We have a large oven, so contact us about your bigger jobs!</p>
